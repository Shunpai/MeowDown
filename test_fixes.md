- **Fix**: 
  - Complete rewrite of JavaScript animation
  - Added unique container IDs to avoid conflicts
  - Better CSS keyframes animation
  - Added fallback celebration text
  - Fixed timing and positioning

### 📁 **Open Downloads Folder Button**
- **Problem**: Button didn't work to open folder
- **Fix**: 
  - Better error handling with try/catch
  - Using `subprocess.run()` instead of `os.startfile()`
  - Check if folder exists first
  - Show manual path if opening fails
  - Added debug info in sidebar

   - "MEOW!" bouncing text

4. You should see:

## 🎯 **Expected Results:**

**Floating Cats Should:**
- ✅ Float up from bottom of screen
- ✅ Spin as they rise
- ✅ Fade out at the top
- ✅ Show 12 cats with delays between them
- ✅ Include hearts and different cat faces

**Folder Button Should:**
- ✅ Open Windows Explorer (on Windows)
- ✅ Show success message "Opening your downloads folder!"
- ✅ If it fails, show the manual path
- ✅ Work even if folder path has spaces

If either still doesn't work, check the browser's developer console (F12) for JavaScript errors!
